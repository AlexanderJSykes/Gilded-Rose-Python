## Setup
Dependencies are managed via Poetry. (Instructions [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) if you don't already have it)

To install dependencies, just run
```shell script
poetry install
```

To run the test, run `pytest` from inside a poetry shell (which you can open by running `poetry shell`).
